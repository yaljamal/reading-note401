## JSX

 it is a syntax extension to JavaScript EX :`` `const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; ` ``
  it using with React to describe what the UI should look like.

  JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
  This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions

  JSX Represents Objects :
  Babel compiles JSX down to `` `React.createElement()` `` calls.

  `ReactDOM.render()` => to render the value in HTML page
 ` <div id="root"></div> ` 
 `const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>; `
 `ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));`
