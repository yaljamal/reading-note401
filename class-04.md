1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?

 - Higher quality.
 - Reduced cost. 
 - Quicker time to market
 - Clearer scope
 - Faster performance
 - Better documentation
 - Fewer application errors

## Conceptual Techniques for data models 

 1. Denormalization
 2. Aggregates
 3. Composition

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
    - stand for (create, read, update, and delete)

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
    - PostgreSQL is a general purpose and object-relational database management system, the most advanced open source database system
    - MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema

Main advantage is abstraction over pure mongo.

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?

 * Many developers who come from SQL database types feel very uncomfortable working with dynamic collections that have no structure defined. So Schemas in the first place helps with that.

5. Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally

 * NoSQL databases are designed to expand horizontally and in Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

6. Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
- Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL database is Open Source and Open Source at its greatest strength 

7. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
* Constraints are the rules that force DBMSs to check that data satisfies the semantics

8. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
 1. Amazon DynamoDB
 2. Garantia Data
 3. IBM Cloudant
