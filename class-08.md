# Routing 
Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.
You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app. METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function

# Route methods
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.
