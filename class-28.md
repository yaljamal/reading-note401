# Authentication + Role Based Authorization
* Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

## BENEFITS OF RBAC
1. Reducing administrative work and IT support
2. Maximizing operational efficiency
3. Improving compliance.

## BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING RBAC
1. `Current Status`: Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security.
2. `Current Roles`: Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determining what each individual team member does may only take a little discussion.
3. `Write a Policy`: Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see.
4. `Make Changes`: Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), it’s time to make the changes.
5. `Continually Adapt`: It’s likely that the first iteration of RBAC will require some tweaking. Early on, you should evaluate your roles and security status frequently.
