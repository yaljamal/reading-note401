# React Testing 

## Snapshots :

    Make assertions on the exact rendered markup 

## Render Testing 

* Similar to snapshots, but allows for jQuery-like inspection of the virtual DOM tree

## Shallow Testing: 

    Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose children.

## Mounting 

* Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state

## Deployment 

The node server is only there to aid in your development. `npm run build`
