# Routing in React

it is can routing to and rout we made it but we need to install npm package called `react-router-dom` and use it when we need , and we should use `<like>` tag  

* Composition

react components are just object so we can pass it in side props Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.

* Hooks

They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
