# Props 
 props are passed into a component with a syntax that looks like HTML attributes,
 the name of the object passed into a component constructor and any prop added to a component in the JSX will be accessible as a property on props

## state
State is like a data store to the ReactJS component. It is mostly used to update the component when user performed some action like clicking button, typing some text, pressing some key

## Handling Events
you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.
