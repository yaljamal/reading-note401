# What is npm(Node Package Manager)?

npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

Open-source developers use npm to share software.

Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

### npm use:

npm is free to use.

package in npm is a directory contains a bunch of folders and files of someone's code

we can download all npm public software packages without any registration or logon.

### Node.js Module

Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope. Also, each module can be placed in a separate .js file under a separate folder.

### Installing npm
npm is installed with Node.js

This means that we have to install Node.js to get npm installed on our computer.


**All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.**

The content of package.json must be written in JSON.

At least two fields must be present in the definition file: name and version.

Managing Dependencies
npm can manage dependencies.

npm can (in one command line) install all the dependencies of a project.

Dependencies are also defined in package.json.

# What is Node.js?

* Node.js is an open source server environment
* Node.js is free
* Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
* Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

### How Node.js handles a file request:

* Sends the task to the computer's file system.
* Ready to handle the next request.
* When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
* Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

**Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.**

### What Can Node.js Do?

1. Node.js can generate dynamic page content
2. Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
3. Node.js can collect form data
4. Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

### What is a Node.js File?
1. Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
2. A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
3. Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
4. Node.js files have extension ".js"


# What is V8?
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.


### What is a node.js server in a nutshell?

A Node.js server provides the mechanisms for connecting to a service and sending/receiving data. This is done through TCP or UDP connections. This allows developers to create their own servers using these protocols or the protocols built upon them (like HTTP)

### What is a Environment variables?

Environment variables are a fundamental part of developing with Node.js, allowing your app to behave differently based on the environment you want them to run in. Wherever your app needs configuration, you use environment variables. And they’re so simple, they’re beautiful!

### Compiler vs Interpreter

Compiler and Interpreter are two different ways to execute a program written in a programming or scripting language.
A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also refereed as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++.

An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab.
