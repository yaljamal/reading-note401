   5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
   6. Optimize the real code.

# How we can solve the problems like programer ?

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

# There is steps to solve the peoblem :

1. Understand => How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
2. Plan => In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
